# Generative Creativity Lab

We are the Generative Creativity Lab (G-CLef), part of the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University.

Our mission is to _empower and enrich human creativity and productivity with generative AI_. We focus primarily on the intersection of music and AI, though we also work on other applications such as programming, gaming, and natural language.

This website is a work in progress! Please check back soon for updates.

## Members

The G-CLef lab is led by [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com), Dannenberg Assistant Professor at CMU CSD.
